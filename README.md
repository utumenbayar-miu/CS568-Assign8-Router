# CS568-Assign8-Router

Pull https://github.com/utumenbayar-miu/todo-list/tree/json. Implement React Router.
- Create the "Home" route that lists todo items in the state.
- Create the "AddTodo" route. It doesn't have to be functional for now. We will fix that in the next 2 days.
- Create the "Details" route that displays item id which is a path parameter. Add details link to the todoItem component.
